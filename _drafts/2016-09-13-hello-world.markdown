description: A “Hello, World!” program is simple. For me, it is an analogy for the rest of our hard-wired behavior.

A "Hello, World!" program is simple. If the program compiles and executes successfully, it will display a text greeting to the user. Naturally, this can be written using multiple programming languages. Each is likely to have a de-facto form and probably [variants][hello-world-code-golf] too. The makes for a useful demonstration of the syntax a language uses.

However, the simplicity serves a greater purpose, for the same reason I used it as a starting point today. "Hello, World!" is a proof of concept, a test. In the case of programming, this tests that an enviroment is operational, an encouraing signal for more advanced usage. Given that, it is analagous to our [interactions][hard-wired] with everything else. Like flipping a switch, checking the weather, or publishing a first blog post. We use it all the time.
